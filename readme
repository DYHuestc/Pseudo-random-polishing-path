Pseudo random path generates code, but I am currently unable to complete the path. I request your assistance in improving the code.
The pseudo random paths have the following characteristics:
1. The machining path passes through all the set dwell points in the machining area
2. Each well point is passed through only once
3. The machining paths are continuous and do not cross
